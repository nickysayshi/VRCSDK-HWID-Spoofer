# A VRChat HWID Spoofer for the Unity SDK.
- The Spoofer is ment to be used with the default VRChat SDK and may break any modified SDKs.
- The HWID Spoofer was taken from NanoSDK (https://nanosdk.net/) and made to be a standalone option and more simplistic.
- HWID File can be found in "Assets\VRCSDK\HWID.txt".
- Use the same HWID used in VRChat to prevent constant Unusual Client Behaviour.
- HWIDPatch is recommended with this tool (https://github.com/knah/ML-UniversalMods/tree/main/HWIDPatch).
